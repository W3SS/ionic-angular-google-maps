Integration of the Ionic Framework and GoogleMap AngularJS Directive by AngularUI

I will be sharing how to integrate the GoogleMap AngularJS Directive by AngularJS UI with Ionic Framework.

Disclaimer: I am still playing around with Ionic Framework and AngularJS so please forgive me if there is any performance issue or bugs :D. Let me know if you can resolve any of those issues. Cheers!

Please visit https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/ to download the directive if you have an existing project.

I prefer to use the sidemenu template so i would just use that, you may try the tabs as well.

ionic start <project name> sidemenu
